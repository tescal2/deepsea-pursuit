# 🦞 Deep Sea Pursuit

A satirical Flappy Bird-style game for the Azure ACR team. Navigate the **pipeline** as a blue lobster, collect **MACCs** (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments) for revenue multipliers, and try to hit quota across all four quarters.

## The Satire

- **Obstacles = Pipeline deals** — color-coded by fiscal quarter (Q1→Q4)
- **MACCs = Cheeseburger collectibles** — boost your revenue multiplier (it's a play on words 🍔)
- **Score = Revenue** — displayed in $K/$M
- **Quarterly quotas** — attainment % tracked in real-time
- **Game over** — shows if you hit quota, missed it, or reached stretch
- **Lifetime stats** — tracks fiscal runs, average revenue, best quarter reached

## Difficulty Progression

| Quarter | Color | Difficulty | Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Q1 | Azure Blue | Easy | Wide gaps, slow scroll |
| Q2 | Cyan | Medium | Gaps tighten slightly |
| Q3 | Gold | Hard | Pipeline gets tight... |
| Q4 | Red | Gauntlet | Final push! Close the year! |

## Controls

- **Tap / Click / Spacebar** — swim up
- Navigate the pipeline, collect MACCs 🍔, hit quota!
